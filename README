 INTRODUCTION
==============

KFTPGrabber - A graphical FTP client for KDE

There are many FTP clients around these days. Most are console based, some
feature a graphical user interface. What most clients are missing is support 
for latest or not so common technologies like ZeroConf, TLS/SSL or FXP (just
to name a few), accompanied by a decent user interface that tries to support
the user instead of frustrating him/her.

KFTPGrabber tries to make a complete FTP client solution with support for
plugins, scripting and everything else the users needs, based on the
latest technologies provided by KDE.

Here are some of the features:

  - Multiple FTP sessions (tabs) 
  - Transfer queue 
  - TLS/SSL support for encrypted connections (implicit and explicit)
  - Partial X509 certificate support for authentication
  - FXP transfer support (site-to-site) 
  - OTP (one time password) support - S/Key, MD5, RMD160, SHA1 
  - Drag&Drop support 
  - Site bookmarking 
  - Encrypted bookmark support (password can be saved to KWallet) 
  - Distributed FTP support (PRET) 
  - SSCN and CPSV support 
  - Skiplist 
  - ZeroConf (aka. Rendezvous) support for local site discovery 
  - Bookmark sharing with Kopete contacts (KDE >= 3.3) 
  - Bookmark import plugins 
  - Support for SFTP protocol [experimental]
